# Analysis pipeline for the manuscript "Proteomic Characterization of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Identifies Risk-Stratifying Subgroups, Proteins Associated with Time-To-Recurrence, and mTOR Effector Molecule EIF4A1 as a Druggable Therapeutic Target"

This manuscript is based on proteomic data from a human cohort of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) comprising 80 tumor and 77 tumor-adjacent, non-malignant (TANM) tissue samples from 80 patients. This cohort was analyzed in DIA-NN 1.7 twice: once with a fully tryptic database and once with a semi-specific database to study potential proteolytic events. Additionally, we also analyzed 9 patient-derived ICC xenografts (PDX) with DIA-NN. To recreate our analyses you can download all DIA-NN output files at ..., add them to the data folder, and start the analysis from the very first step. You can also use the provided expression matrices in the data folder and begin directly with the statistical analysis (scripts 2-7). The entire xenograft cohort can be analyzed with script 8, again starting with the DIA-NN output or directly with the provided expression matrix in the data folder.

All scripts are numbered according to which steps in the project / manuscript they cover. 

The code for the classifier model is not made available here, since it is currently being prepared for a separate publication. It will be made publicly available before this manuscript eventually proceeds to being accepted.
